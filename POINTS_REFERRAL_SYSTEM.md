# Points & Referral System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive points and referral system to PingSpace, allowing users to earn points through various activities and redeem them for rewards. Users can also refer friends to earn additional points.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Points System
- **Points Earning**: Users earn points for:
  - Making purchases (1 point per $1 spent)
  - Referring friends (500 points per successful referral)
  - Signing up (100 points welcome bonus)
  - Daily login (5 points)
  - Social sharing (25 points)
  - Writing reviews (50 points)

- **Tier System**: Users progress through tiers based on total points earned:
  - **Bronze** (0-999 points): 1x multiplier
  - **Silver** (1,000-4,999 points): 1.2x multiplier
  - **Gold** (5,000-14,999 points): 1.5x multiplier
  - **Platinum** (15,000+ points): 2x multiplier

- **Points Expiry**: Points expire after 365 days to encourage active usage

### 2. Rewards System
- **Discount Rewards**:
  - $5 off purchase (500 points)
  - 10% off purchase (750 points)
  - Free shipping (300 points)
  - $25 gift card (2,500 points)

- **Redemption Process**: Users can redeem points for rewards, receiving unique redemption codes

### 3. Referral System
- **Referral Code Generation**: Each user can generate a unique referral code
- **Sharing Options**: Users can share referral codes via:
  - Social media
  - SMS
  - Copy to clipboard
- **Rewards**: Both referrer and referee earn points when someone signs up using a referral code

### 4. User Interface
- **Points Display**: Shows current points balance in profile and marketplace
- **Points & Rewards Screen**: Comprehensive interface with three tabs:
  - Overview: Points summary and tier progress
  - Rewards: Available rewards and redemption
  - Referrals: Referral code management and tracking

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Context Architecture
- **PointsContext**: Manages all points-related state and operations
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing WalletContext and AuthContext

### 2. Data Storage
- **AsyncStorage**: All points data is persisted locally
- **Data Structure**: Comprehensive types for points, transactions, rewards, and referrals

### 3. Key Components
- **PointsProvider**: Context provider for points system
- **PointsRewardsScreen**: Main interface for points management
- **PointsDisplay**: Reusable component showing points balance

### 4. Integration Points
- **Registration**: Added referral code field to signup process
- **Marketplace**: Points display and automatic points awarding on purchases
- **Profile**: Points balance and navigation to rewards screen

## Files Added/Modified

- `src/screens/PointsRewardsScreen.tsx` - Main points interface
- `src/components/points/PointsDisplay.tsx` - Points balance component
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added points-related types

### Modified Files
- `App.tsx` - Added PointsProvider
- `src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` - Added PointsRewards screen

## Usage Examples

### Earning Points
```typescript
// Award points for a purchase
await earnPoints(
  100, // amount
  'purchase', // source
  'Purchase reward: 100 points for $100 purchase',
  { purchaseAmount: 100, orderId: 'ORDER_123' }
);
```

### Redeeming Rewards
```typescript
// Redeem a reward
const redemption = await redeemPoints('discount_5');
// Returns redemption with code: PINGABC123
```

### Referral Process
```typescript
// Generate referral code
const referralCode = await generateReferralCode();
// Returns: { code: 'PINGABC123', shareLink: 'https://pingspace.app/join?ref=PINGABC123' }

// Process referral signup
await processReferralSignup('PINGABC123', 'newUserId');
// Awards 500 points to referrer, 200 points to new user
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace AsyncStorage with API calls
2. **Push Notifications**: Notify users of points earned/expiring
3. **Social Features**: Leaderboards and point sharing
4. **Advanced Rewards**: Time-limited offers and personalized rewards
5. **Analytics**: Track referral performance and points usage patterns
6. **Gamification**: Achievements and badges for various activities

## Configuration

The points system is highly configurable through the `pointsSettings` object in `PointsContext.tsx`:

```typescript
const pointsSettings: PointsSettings = {
  isEnabled: true,
  pointsPerDollarSpent: 1,
  referralPoints: {
    referrer: 500,
    referee: 200,
  },
  signupBonus: 100,
  dailyLoginPoints: 5,
  socialSharePoints: 25,
  reviewPoints: 50,
  pointsExpiryDays: 365,
  minimumRedemption: 100,
  tierBonusEnabled: true,
};
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a points and referral system that can drive user engagement and growth for the PingSpace app.
